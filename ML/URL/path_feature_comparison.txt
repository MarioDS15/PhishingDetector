Path Feature Enhancement - Performance Comparison
================================================================================

BEFORE (6 Path Features):
  - path_length
  - path_depth
  - num_slashes
  - trailing_slash
  - brand_similarity_path
  - brand_in_path_or_query

  Performance:
    Accuracy:  82.82%
    Precision: 77.06%
    Recall:    99.93%
    F1-Score:  87.01%
    ROC AUC:   79.89%

AFTER (22 Path Features - Added 16 new features):
  Original 6 features +
  - path_segment_count
  - avg_path_segment_length
  - max_path_segment_length
  - path_entropy
  - path_has_numbers
  - path_has_special_chars
  - path_digit_ratio
  - path_letter_ratio
  - has_legitimate_path
  - legitimate_path_count
  - has_suspicious_path
  - suspicious_path_count
  - path_starts_with_slash
  - path_ends_with_slash
  - path_has_double_slash
  - path_has_query_in_path

  Performance:
    Accuracy:  82.86% (+0.04%)
    Precision: 77.07% (+0.01%)
    Recall:    99.98% (+0.05%)
    F1-Score:  87.05% (+0.04%)
    ROC AUC:   79.93% (+0.04%)

IMPROVEMENT SUMMARY:
  - Features added: +16 (from 6 to 22)
  - Accuracy improvement: +0.04%
  - F1-Score improvement: +0.04%
  - ROC AUC improvement: +0.04%
  - False Positives: 6,092 (high, but expected for path-only model)
  - False Negatives: 4 (very low - good recall)

KEY INSIGHTS:
  1. Path model accuracy improved slightly with more features
  2. The new features help distinguish legitimate paths (has_legitimate_path)
  3. Path entropy and structure features add granularity
  4. When combined with domain model (75/25 weights), should reduce false positives
  5. The legitimate_path_count feature should help with sites like canvas.gmu.edu/login

NEXT STEPS:
  - Export models to JavaScript format
  - Test weighted predictions (75% domain, 25% path) on canvas.gmu.edu URLs
  - Compare false positive rates on legitimate sites with login paths
